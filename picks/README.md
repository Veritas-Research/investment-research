# Stock Picks

Just stock selections with entry prices, position sizes, and rationale.

Each file *should* document:
- Stock selections with ticker symbols
- Entry prices and dates
- Position sizing
- Link to supporting thesis
- Expected returns and timeframe

Files are named: `YYYY-QX-picks.md` (e.g., `2026-Q1-picks.md`)
