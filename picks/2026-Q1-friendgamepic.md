# Q1 2026 Stock Picks as a friendly game

## The Setup

Playing a stock-picking game with friends—best 3 stocks for 2026, winner takes bragging rights. 

On a Friday afternoon (January 16, 2026), before the deadline, I spent a few hours researching based on some investment themes I'd been thinking about. You can read the full thesis here once I write it up.

**Full disclosure:** I originally chose these on January 16, but I can't prove it (no screenshots, no text receipts). So for this portfolio tracker, I'm using **January 24, 2026 prices**—the day I actually started documenting this properly on GitHub.

## The Picks

| **Stock** | **Ticker** | **Entry Date** | **Entry Price** | **Position Size** |

| **Snowflake** | SNOW | Jan 24, 2026 | $209.00 [[2]](#citations) | 1 share |

**Total Investment:** ~$547.30

## Position Sizing Rationale

This is a friendly competition, not my actual portfolio allocation. I bought **1 share of each** just to have skin in the game. 

If this were a real portfolio with meaningful capital, I'd weight them differently:
- **Zscaler:** 35% (highest conviction—defense + AI cybersecurity)
- **Snowflake:** 35% (proven execution, enterprise AI infrastructure)
- **UiPath:** 30% (asymmetric upside, cheapest valuation)

But for this game? Equal shares. Keep it simple.

## Investment Thesis (TL;DR)

**Core thesis:** AI + Defense = Cybersecurity dominance, with enterprise AI transformation as the second derivative play.

1. **Zscaler (ZS)** — Defense + AI cybersecurity. Zero Trust architecture is becoming the DoD/government standard. Fastest-growing revenue among major cybersecurity names. Clean exposure to both AI security and defense spending.

2. **Snowflake (SNOW)** — Enterprise AI data infrastructure. Growing 32% YoY with 50% of new customers influenced by AI use cases. Trading at 14.3x P/S—half of Palantir's 67.5x P/S for similar growth profile. Every AI deployment needs a data warehouse.

3. **UiPath (PATH)** — Agentic AI asymmetric bet. $8.2B market cap at 4-5x P/S (cheapest valuation of all enterprise AI plays). Customers include Microsoft, OpenAI, Alphabet. RPA is the foundation for agentic workflows. If agentic AI explodes in 2026, this has 2-3x upside.

## Expected Returns & Timeframe

**Timeframe:** Through December 31, 2026 (game end date)

**Expected returns:** Honestly? I don't know. 

If I'm right about AI + defense cyber being the mega-theme of 2026, these could be up 30-60% by year-end. If AI spending slows or there's a recession, they could be down 20-30% (or worse—remember, high P/S stocks get murdered in corrections).

This isn't about precision. It's about:
- Picking a clear thesis (AI + defense + cybersecurity)
- Finding reasonable valuations (avoided Palantir at 67x P/S)
- Getting exposure to second/third-derivative plays (not just buying NVIDIA)
- Documenting the process so I can learn from it

**My personal benchmark:** If these beat the S&P 500 by year-end, I'll call it a win. If they don't, I'll write up what went wrong and adjust the framework.

## Trade Journal Notes

**Why I'm tracking this publicly:**
- Forces discipline (can't backfill picks or cherry-pick winners)
- Documents my investment process (more valuable than results)
- Builds a portfolio of research for future career optionality
- Keeps me honest about what worked and what didn't

**What I'll track:**
- Quarterly price updates (maybe)
- Quarterly earnings reactions 
- Thesis validation checkpoints (Is AI spending accelerating? Are defense cyber budgets growing?)
- Mistakes and lessons learned

## The Meta-Goal

Win or lose, this is about building the muscle of:
1. Forming an investment thesis
2. Finding companies that fit it
3. Buying at reasonable valuations
4. Tracking whether the thesis plays out
5. Learning from the outcome

Results matter, but **process compounds**.

Good luck, me.
