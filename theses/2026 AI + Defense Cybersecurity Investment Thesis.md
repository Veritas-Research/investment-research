## How I Got Here

A friend of mine proposed a game: pick your top three stocks for 2026, and we'll see whose portfolio performs best by year end. Winner gets bragging rights. I took this as an excuse to spend a Friday afternoon doing something I've been meaning to do anyway: put my thoughts on paper about where I think the market is heading.

For months now, my friends and I have been debating two topics that keep coming up: artificial intelligence and defense spending. These aren't just trending topics. They feel like the defining forces of this decade. AI speaks for itself at this point. Every company is scrambling to integrate it, every tech earnings call mentions it, and the infrastructure build out is unlike anything I've seen in my career.

But defense spending is the quieter story that I think people are underestimating. We're living in a world where borders matter again, where sovereignty is not just a political talking point but an economic and technological imperative. Countries are realizing that control over technology, data, and infrastructure is as important as control over physical territory. The conflicts we're seeing aren't just about land anymore. They're about who controls the digital layer underneath everything.

That realization led me to a simple thesis: the intersection of AI and defense is where the next decade of value creation happens. And specifically, I think the battleground isn't physical hardware like planes and missiles. It's cybersecurity. Digital warfare. The ability to defend and attack in software.

This thesis document is my attempt to connect those dots, show my research process, and explain why I ended up picking three specific stocks: Zscaler, Snowflake, and UiPath.

## The Macro Themes: Why AI and Defense Converge

Let me start with the big picture. I spent time watching Steve Eisman's Weekly Wrap from January 9, 2026, where he breaks down five long term structural themes shaping the market. Steve Eisman is the guy from "The Big Short," and he's now a managing director focused on market structure. His framework helped me understand why certain sectors are dominating and others are fading.

At the same time, I read Dan Ives' piece on the AI revolution. Ives is the Wedbush tech analyst who's been early on Tesla, Apple, and Nvidia. His argument is that we're in the "second or third inning" of AI spending, not the ninth. He calls it the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and he's tracking where the $2 trillion in AI spending over the next two years will flow.

Here's what clicked for me: Eisman explains how the market structure has fundamentally changed. Ives explains where the opportunity is within that new structure. Together, they gave me a lens to filter through hundreds of potential investments.

### Why Sovereignty Drives Defense and AI Spending

Every country with the means to do so is asking the same question: how do we maintain sovereignty in a world where technology is the foundation of power? That means:

**Domestic AI infrastructure.** Countries don't want to rely on foreign cloud providers for their most sensitive workloads. The U.S., China, and Europe are all building sovereign AI capabilities.

**Cybersecurity as national defense.** Traditional kinetic warfare still matters, but the real frontline is digital. Protecting critical infrastructure, government systems, and private sector networks from state sponsored attacks is now a top priority.

**Supply chain control.** Semiconductors, data centers, and software platforms are strategic assets. Governments are subsidizing domestic production and restricting access to adversaries.

This isn't speculation. In January 2026, the Pentagon awarded $200 million in AI contracts to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Elon Musk's xAI. Another $12.6 million went to a stealth startup called "Twenty" for AI powered offensive cyber capabilities. These are real dollars flowing into the intersection of AI and defense.

The companies that enable governments and enterprises to build, secure, and operate AI infrastructure are going to capture a disproportionate share of that spending. That's the thesis in one sentence.

## The Eisman Framework: How the Market Structure Changed

Steve Eisman's analysis helped me understand why tech stocks dominate today and why that creates both opportunity and risk. He calls out five structural themes. Let me walk through them because they're the foundation for how I filtered stocks.

### Theme One: Tech and Tech Related Stocks Dominate the Market

As of December 31, 2025, the Information Technology sector alone represents 35% of the S&P 500. If you add Communication Services, which includes Meta, Google, and Netflix, you're at 46%. If you stretch the definition to include Amazon and other tech adjacent companies, you're easily at 50%.

Let me put that in perspective. Ten years ago, in 2015, that same grouping was 36%. Today it's 50%. No other developed country in the world has this level of tech concentration in its stock market.

The top three companies by weight are Nvidia at 7.7%, Apple at 6.8%, and Microsoft at 6.1%. Just those three stocks represent over 20% of the entire S&P 500. That's not normal. That's a structural shift.

### Theme Two and Three: Consumer Stocks Matter Less, and the Market is Divorced from Consumer Health

Here's where it gets interesting. Consumer facing sectors, healthcare, consumer discretionary, and consumer staples, have shrunk from 38% of the S&P 500 in 2015 to just 25% in 2025. That's a 13 percentage point decline in a decade.

And yet, consumer spending represents 70% of U.S. GDP. So we have a situation where the stock market's performance is increasingly disconnected from the health of the consumer economy.

Eisman calls this the market being "unmoored from everyday life." Regular people are worried about healthcare costs, housing affordability, and the price of groceries. But those sectors don't move the S&P 500 anymore. Tech does.

This matters because it means the market can power through consumer weakness as long as AI and tech spending hold up. The flip side is that if AI spending slows or there's a recession, the concentration risk is enormous.

### Theme Four: The Market is Unmoored from Everyday Life

This is the K shaped economy manifesting in the stock market. Entire sectors like housing, consumer discretionary, and even parts of healthcare can struggle, but as long as tech and AI are thriving, the indexes keep climbing.

Eisman's warning is stark: "Even if parts of the K shaped economy get worse, the market might, I repeat, might power through it as long as current tech and AI trends remain intact. However, if there is ever a recession or if AI spending does slow, there is going to be a rush to the exits. The decline will almost certainly be fast and very ugly."

### Theme Five: Index Investing Amplifies All These Trends

Here's the structural mechanic that ties everything together. Sixty percent of equity flows go to passive index funds and ETFs. That means 60 cents of every dollar invested in the stock market is not the result of a human being making a decision. It's just index funds buying the same stocks they already own, in the same proportions, automatically.

Because most indices are market cap weighted, this creates a feedback loop. Tech stocks get bigger, so they get a higher weight in the index, so passive flows buy more of them, so they get even bigger. Steve Eisman calls it "the big getting bigger."

The implication is clear: as long as passive inflows continue, tech stocks benefit disproportionately. But if there's ever a rush to the exits, those same passive flows become sellers, and there won't be enough active buyers to provide liquidity. The decline would be fast and brutal.

This framework told me two things. First, I need to focus on tech and AI, because that's where the structural tailwinds are. Second, I need to be disciplined about valuation, because the downside risk in a correction is massive.

## The Ives Framework: Where the Value Lives

Dan Ives gave me the second lens: not all AI exposure is created equal. He breaks the opportunity into layers.

**First order plays** are the obvious ones. Nvidia, Microsoft, Palantir. These are great companies, but they're also crowded trades. Nvidia trades at 57 times earnings. Palantir trades at 67.5 times sales. You're paying for perfection.

**Second and third derivative plays** are where Ives sees the alpha. These are companies that benefit from AI adoption but aren't as obvious or as expensive. His key insight is that as enterprises move from "AI experimentation" to "AI production," the value shifts from infrastructure to application and security layers.

Ives specifically calls out cybersecurity as a structural winner. His logic is simple: AI expands the attack surface. More AI workloads, more endpoints, more data flows, more vulnerabilities. At the same time, AI enables more sophisticated attacks. The only way to keep up is with AI powered defense.

He highlights CrowdStrike as the "gold standard" with a $150 billion addressable market for agentic AI security. He also mentions Zscaler and Palo Alto Networks as beneficiaries of the same trend.

For enterprise AI transformation, Ives points to the inflection point happening in 2026. RBC Capital Markets echoed this: "Enterprise AI adoption will reach an inflection point in 2026, transitioning from board level conversations and pilot stage experimentation to measurable enterprise ROI gains."

That tells me the opportunity is shifting from "building AI infrastructure" (first order) to "deploying AI applications and securing them" (second and third order). That's where I focused my research.

## My Stock Selection Process

I started with a universe of about 50 companies across cybersecurity, enterprise software, cloud infrastructure, and data platforms. I filtered them using these criteria:

**Criterion one: Exposure to both AI and defense spending.** I wanted companies that benefit from both secular trends, not just one. That meant cybersecurity companies with government contracts, or enterprise software companies enabling AI deployments for defense and commercial customers.

**Criterion two: Reasonable valuation relative to growth.** I learned what Price to Sales ratio actually means while doing this research. It's the stock price divided by sales per share. So if a company has $100 million in revenue and 10 million shares outstanding, that's $10 per share in sales. If the stock price is $150, the P/S ratio is 15x.

For high growth SaaS companies, P/S is often more useful than P/E because many of them are not yet profitable or are reinvesting heavily. A P/S of 10 to 15x is reasonable if the company is growing revenue at 25 to 35% per year. Above 20x, you're paying for perfection. Above 50x, you're in bubble territory.

I also looked at PEG ratio, which is the P/E ratio divided by earnings growth rate. A PEG below 1.0 means the stock is undervalued relative to growth. Above 2.0 means it's expensive. This helped me avoid value traps, companies with low P/E ratios but no growth.

**Criterion three: Insider ownership and customer validation.** I wanted to see that management had skin in the game and that blue chip customers were adopting the product. If Microsoft, OpenAI, or the Department of Defense are customers, that's a strong signal.

**Criterion four: Differentiated technology or market position.** I avoided commoditized businesses. I wanted companies with moats: network effects, switching costs, or technical advantages that are hard to replicate.

After filtering, I ended up with a shortlist of seven companies. I spent time on each, reading earnings transcripts, checking analyst reports, and comparing valuations. Three stood out: Zscaler, Snowflake, and UiPath.

## The Three Picks: Deep Dive

### Pick One: Zscaler (Ticker: ZS)

**Entry price:** $323.00 (January 24, 2026)

**Why Zscaler fits the thesis:** Zscaler is a network security company built around Zero Trust architecture. The concept is simple: never trust, always verify. In traditional security models, once you're inside the corporate network, you have broad access. Zero Trust assumes every access request is a potential threat and requires continuous verification.

This matters for two reasons. First, as organizations move workloads to the cloud and adopt hybrid work, the traditional perimeter based security model breaks down. Zero Trust is the new standard. Second, government and defense agencies are mandating Zero Trust. The Department of Defense, in particular, has made it a priority.

Zscaler is FedRAMP certified, which means it meets the security requirements for U.S. government cloud services. It's also the fastest growing among the major cybersecurity names, with revenue growth accelerating rather than decelerating.

**Valuation:** Zscaler trades at a P/S ratio that's cheaper than CrowdStrike but in the same ballpark as other high growth cybersecurity companies. It's not cheap in absolute terms, but it's reasonable given the growth rate and market position.

**What I'm betting on:** Zero Trust becomes the standard for government, defense, and enterprise security over the next three to five years. Zscaler captures a disproportionate share of that market. AI workloads increase the need for network security, and Zscaler's cloud native architecture scales better than legacy solutions.

**Risk:** If there's a recession or if cybersecurity spending slows, Zscaler's valuation compresses quickly. It's also a crowded trade, so any earnings miss or guidance cut could trigger a sharp selloff.

---

### Pick Two: Snowflake (Ticker: SNOW)

**Entry price:** $209.00 (January 24, 2026)

**Why Snowflake fits the thesis:** Snowflake is a cloud data platform. Every AI model needs data to train on and to run inference against. Snowflake's value proposition is that it makes it easy to store, query, and share data across different cloud providers and on premises systems.

In Q2 of fiscal 2026, Snowflake reported $1.09 billion in product revenue, growing 32% year over year. More importantly, nearly 50% of their new customer logos are influenced by AI use cases, and 25% of all deployed use cases involve AI. They have over 6,100 accounts using Snowflake's AI capabilities on a weekly basis.

That tells me Snowflake is not just talking about AI, they're actually capturing revenue from it.

**Valuation:** Snowflake trades at a P/S ratio of 14.3x. To put that in context, Palantir trades at 67.5x P/S for a similar growth rate. Snowflake is literally half the price of Palantir on a sales multiple basis.

Let me walk through why that matters. If Snowflake grows revenue at 30% per year for the next two years, and the stock holds its 14.3x P/S multiple, the stock price should grow roughly in line with revenue, so about 30% per year compounded. That gets you to a 70% return over two years.

If the multiple expands to 18x P/S (still cheaper than Palantir), you get an additional 25% boost. That's over 100% total return in two years.

Conversely, if the multiple compresses to 10x P/S, you lose 30% even if revenue grows. That's the risk.

**What I'm betting on:** Every AI deployment needs a data warehouse. Snowflake is one of the top two players (the other being Databricks, which is private). As enterprises move from AI pilots to production, they'll need more data infrastructure, not less. Snowflake's multi cloud architecture and ease of use give it a structural advantage.

**Risk:** Competition from Databricks and hyperscalers (AWS, Google, Microsoft) building their own data warehouses. If revenue growth slows below 25%, the valuation multiple compresses quickly.

---

### Pick Three: UiPath (Ticker: PATH)

**Entry price:** $15.30 (January 24, 2026)

**Why UiPath fits the thesis:** UiPath is the most contrarian pick. It's a robotic process automation company, which means it helps enterprises automate repetitive tasks like data entry, invoice processing, and customer service workflows. RPA has been around for years, but it's getting a second life with agentic AI.

Agentic AI is the idea that AI agents can perform multi step tasks autonomously. Instead of just answering a question, an agent can execute a workflow: check inventory, update a database, send a notification, and generate a report. UiPath's platform is the foundation for building those agents.

Here's what caught my attention. UiPath has a market cap of $8.2 billion and trades at a P/S ratio of 4 to 5x. Compare that to CrowdStrike at $127.8 billion and 24.7x P/S, or even Snowflake at 14.3x P/S. UiPath is the cheapest valuation in my entire research universe for a company with blue chip customers.

Those customers include Microsoft, OpenAI, and Alphabet. They have nearly 10,900 total customers, with over 2,500 paying more than $100,000 in annual recurring revenue. The company is profitable on a free cash flow basis.

**Valuation:** This is where the teaching moment comes in. UiPath's P/S of 4 to 5x looks cheap, but there's a reason. Revenue growth has slowed to 11% on an ARR basis and 16% on a sales basis. That's not bad, but it's not the 30 to 50% growth you see in hot AI stocks.

The market is waiting for proof that UiPath can reaccelerate growth by pivoting to agentic AI. RBC Capital Markets said, "2026 is likely to be a year when AI tailwinds become more evident" for UiPath. DA Davidson raised their price target to $15 from $12 but noted they're "waiting for more consistent execution."

So the market is skeptical but starting to come around. That's exactly when I want to buy.

**What I'm betting on:** Agentic AI takes off in 2026, and UiPath is the platform enterprises use to build and deploy agents. If that happens, revenue growth reaccelerates to 20 to 25%, and the P/S multiple expands from 5x to 10x. That's a double or triple from here.

Even if I'm wrong about agentic AI, UiPath is a profitable, cash generative business with blue chip customers at a $8.2 billion valuation. The downside is limited.

**Risk:** Execution risk. UiPath has had management turnover and inconsistent results. If they can't prove that agentic AI drives revenue, the stock stays range bound. There's also competition from Microsoft (Power Automate) and others building automation into their platforms.

## Real World Examples: Why These Companies Are Winning

**Zscaler:** In November 2025, Zscaler's Charlotte AI achieved FedRAMP High Authorization. This is a big deal. FedRAMP High means the platform can handle classified government data and work with the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community. It positions Zscaler for agentic Security Operations Center automation in the public sector. Federal spending on Zscaler has been growing 70% year over year, and this authorization unlocks even more growth.

**Snowflake:** In Q2 fiscal 2026, Snowflake reported that 6,100 accounts are using their AI capabilities weekly. That's not a vanity metric. It's actual usage, which translates to revenue. They also said nearly 50% of new customer logos are influenced by AI, which means the sales team is winning deals specifically because of AI features. That validates the product market fit.

**UiPath:** UiPath announced that their customer list includes Microsoft, OpenAI, and Alphabet. These are companies building the AI platforms that everyone else uses. If they're using UiPath for automation, that's a strong signal that the technology works. RBC upgraded their price target after Q3 results, citing "solid execution" and increasing confidence in the agentic AI pivot.

## What I'm Betting On (And What Could Go Wrong)

**High conviction:** The macro thesis. AI and defense spending converge, and cybersecurity is the primary battleground. Governments and enterprises will spend trillions over the next decade to secure AI infrastructure. The market structure favors tech concentration, and passive flows amplify winners.

**Medium conviction:** These specific stocks. Zscaler, Snowflake, and UiPath are good companies, but there are other ways to play the thesis. CrowdStrike, Datadog, and Palo Alto Networks are legitimate alternatives. I could be wrong on which specific companies win.

**What could prove me wrong:**

**AI spending slows.** If hyperscalers like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google cut their AI capex, the entire thesis breaks. That could happen if economic growth slows or if AI fails to deliver ROI for enterprises.

**Recession.** Eisman's warning about "a rush to the exits" is real. If there's a recession, high P/S stocks like these get crushed. Passive flows reverse, liquidity dries up, and multiples compress by 50% or more.

**Execution risk.** UiPath in particular needs to prove it can reaccelerate growth. If management stumbles, the stock stays flat even if the thesis is right.

**Competition.** All three companies face intense competition. Zscaler competes with Palo Alto Networks and CrowdStrike. Snowflake competes with Databricks and hyperscaler data warehouses. UiPath competes with Microsoft and others. If they lose market share, valuations reset lower.

I'm actively tracking these risks. If I see signs that AI spending is slowing or that any of these companies are losing competitive position, I'll reassess.

## Why I'm Sharing This Publicly

This thesis is rough. I'm sure I'll look back in a year and see things I got wrong or things I should have dug deeper on. But I'm publishing it anyway because I believe the best way to learn is to teach, and the best way to improve is to put your ideas out there and get feedback.

I'm also doing this for accountability. By timestamping my picks and my reasoning on GitHub, I can't backfill my analysis or cherry pick winners later. If I'm wrong, I'll document what I missed and what I learned. If I'm right, I'll have a track record that shows how I think about investing.

The game with my friends is just the excuse. The real goal is to build a disciplined, repeatable process for researching and tracking investments. This is the start of that journey.
